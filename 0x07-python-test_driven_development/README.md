## Background Context

### Important notice on intranet checks for Python projects

Starting from today:
- Based on the requirements of each task, you should always write the documentation (module(s) + function(s)) and tests first, before you actually code anything
- The intranet checks for Python projects won’t be released before their first deadline, in order for you to focus more on TDD and think about all possible cases
- We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case. **But not in the implementation of them!**
- **Don’t trust the user**, always think about all possible edge cases

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/), **without the help of Google**:

### General

- Why Python programming is awesome
- What’s an interactive test
- Why tests are important
- How to write Docstrings to create tests
- How to write documentation for each module and function
- What are the basic option flags to create tests
- How to find edge cases
